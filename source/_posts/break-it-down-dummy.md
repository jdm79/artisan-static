(*Disclaimer: I originally meant to publish this article in the week before the start of the Makers course,
but only now (the end of week 9) am I starting to find my bearings from what I can only describe
as being hit by a king wave whilst smiling for a photo, with my back oh-so-naïvely facing the sea. 
The Makers course is very involving.*)

<p class="description">Rigorous curriculum like a big wave or a ray</p>

One of the main reasons I applied to [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) was that learning to code by myself was simply not working. 
Dozens of online tutorials followed slavishly word for word, dutifully pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/jdm79) to rot, 
were teaching me nothing but a keen eye for detail. 

In addition, it taught me to go straight to the comments section at the bottom of any tutorial 
to learn from others why the tutorial app might actually not even work anymore anyway.

Given anything other than relatively straight-forward coding tasks without guidance was beyond me. 
My style was to simply catapult myself against the wall of the problem, 
usually splat and slowly drip down to the ground crumpled, terrified and lost. 
Like trying to smash every single shot in a ping pong match.

Every now and then a moonshot would hit the jackpot, 
but for the most part disaster ensued and I would then scour google for the solutions, 
not really understanding why they were solutions. 

I was remaining a brittle coder relying on memory rather than process.
I came to Makers to learn how to become a good programmer. 
I’d read and seen enough to see that they were clearly successful at this. But I didn’t know how they would help me.

<p class="description">(For context: I am a dog)</p>



Between my first and second [Makers entrance interviews](https://medium.com/@pelensky/makers-academy-interview-preparation-6f13b9542bc0) I did a remote pair programming session 
with a Makers coach ([Jordan Poulton](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/4wfMkMF9rw9gV5m7tBhNDlM/jordan-poulton)) which although daunting at first 
(and something I didn’t really think was going to save me) turned into a revelation. 
I was doing this on instruction of my interviewer Jonny, who had quickly clocked 
my all-or-nothing problem-solving issues, noticing that if I didn’t already know the solution, 
everything quickly caught fire around me. And this is not the Makers way. 

No processes, no back-up plans, no logic — this is never going to end well in the long run. 
During the course of the one-hour pair session with Jordan it indeed became clear what separates 
a good programmer from a bad one: breaking down a problem into small pieces. 
And for me that meant breaking everything down. Even now, we are reminded to read and refine, 
plan, test, then implement.


During the course of the pair session, I suddenly began to enjoy coding again, 
feeling like I’d just been let in on some kind of secret. By building slowly and surely, 
stopping to test and thinking about what I was testing, predicting what the result might be, 
and gleaning every tiny globule of information from the resultant errors, 
I was using processes and incrementing steadily, 
and being able to solve the coding challenges previously terrifying me (looking at you 4-week Makers pre-course).


Whilst the old me only saw the colour of the words in the errors (not green) 
and raised my hands to the heavens in disgust, the new me embraces the red, 
using it to build my programs. By the end of that pair session I was feeling 
that even if I didn’t get into Makers, I’d found the mindset of a programmer at last. 
Even if a coding problem was simply impossible for me, I could at least give it a go 
by using the same processes, getting as close as I could.


By breaking it down into small parts and testing each part incrementally
 I could build up to a solution that at first glance looked complicated, 
 but was actually the product of many small working parts coming together to defeat the problem.
Then we started learning JavaScript.
