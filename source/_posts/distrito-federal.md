Passers-by still stop and stare as they encounter the derelict building just south of Roma Sur. Barricade tape surrounds the perimeter, swallowing one lane of the street as I stand before it. A blue tent is permanently pitched at the eastern entrance, where police shelter from the sun whilst occasionally making rounds to ensure there are no trespassers.

The eight-storey building built in the colours of the Mexican flag, with its green roof tiles, its red external stairwells and its white body, covers half the size of a football pitch, and once housed over 400 people. Those people were made homeless in seconds following the 2017 earthquake.

“[After the earthquake] we were allowed five minutes to go up to our apartments and grab what we could. We had to go up with firemen,” says former resident Diana, a social media manager for an American bank. “I lost pretty much all my possessions. Thieves went through all the apartments taking our things in the days after the earthquake. But I was one of the lucky ones.”

She shows me old photos of the building on her smart phone, vast spidery cracks, with sometimes metres of brick missing. 

“Everybody got out safe. Our building seems to have postponed its collapse,” she says with a wry smile. “They can’t dynamite it to the ground. That would probably take down half the neighbourhood. So it just sits there like that.”

Diana and many others were able to find new accommodation in different parts of the city, but the sense of trepidation remains, that it’s only a matter of time before another big earthquake hits and the people get to find out just how safe their new buildings are. This building serves as a stark reminder of what living in Mexico City involves.
