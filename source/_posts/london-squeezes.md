Data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in December shows that the amount of full-time employees in London earning less than the London Living Wage (LLW) remains high.

This trend has increased sharply since the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent Conservative austerity policies, and the continuing saga of Brexit is unlikely to be positive in this regard.

Women workers suffer most, with 14.4% of full-time female employees earning less than the LLW, compared to 11.3% for their male counterparts.

In 2008, this rate was 8.5% for women and 7.1% for men, marking more than a 60% increase in the last 11 years.

According to the ONS: “The gender pay gap among full-time employees stands at 8.9%, little changed from 2018, and a decline of only 0.6 percentage points since 2012.”

This week, prime minster Boris Johnson outlined plans to increase the National Living Wage (NLW) by 6.2%, saying: "For too long, people haven't seen the pay rises they deserve."

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sajid Javid, added: “We want to end low pay and put more money in the pockets of hard-working families...But we want to do more to level up and tackle the cost of living, which is why the NLW will increase further to £10.50 by 2024 on current forecasts.”

According to the Living Wage Foundation, the LLW is £10.75 per hour, whereas the NLW currently stands at £9.30 per hour.

However, Craig Beaumont from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) recently stated in a BBC interview that raising the NLW would put pressure on businesses, with wage bills swelling, potentially forcing companies out of business, and leading to rising unemployment.

"Wage increases aren't much good to workers if prices rise, jobs are lost and there's no impact on productivity,” said Beaumont, “because employers are forced to cut back on investing in tech, training and equipment."

While the long-term effects of Brexit are still to be determined, the signs are there that it will negatively affect investment and jobs.

The Bank of England stated in November: “The Brexit process has already affected the UK economy… [Brexit has] lowered business investment in particular, and may have weighed on productivity and consumption”

In a Brexit report published in October by the Mayor of London website, economist Mike Hope said: “..productivity growth is likely to be lower than if there had not been an EU Referendum, and is likely to feed through to lower wage growth (after inflation).”
