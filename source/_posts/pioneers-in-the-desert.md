The task of New Yorker Fraser Nelson, vice president of business innovation at The Salt Lake Tribune (SLT)
is to save local news in Utah,
and in the process perhaps halt the expanding news desert spreading across the United States too.
And she’s already achieved what no other legacy newspaper has done in this country: 
persuade the IRS to give a daily newspaper 501(c)(3) status.

##Non-profit status

This means that after almost 150 years the SLT is now a nonprofit: a public charity, and an educational organisation to be precise. By not changing their business model whilst applying for 501(c)(3) status, and being successful, they have opened the door for other newspapers to follow suit without having to give up ad revenue or forgo subscriptions in the process.

“We didn’t know if we’d be approved or not,” Nelson told me in the offices of the SLT on the west side of the city center. “We didn’t know what they’d come back to us with. The fact that they just said: ‘Go for it!’ was kind of shocking to everyone watching this.” 

##Benevolent owner

What has made all of this possible, besides Nelson’s experienced business acumen, is billionaire owner Paul Huntsman’s decision to give up ownership of the paper. After years of losses, Huntsman realised something had to change. Since 2011, staff cuts saw the headcount dwindle from 130 to 60, not all of whom are journalists.

According to the Pew Research Center, newspapers in the USA are a dying breed. As more and more Americans consume their news online, the tangible print media product delivered to our door or mailbox becomes ever more a fragment of the past. Ever since social media behemoths like Facebook and Google arrived on the scene and ate up all the advertisement revenue that newspapers had gorged on for over a century, the future of the newspaper has looked ever bleaker.

“We just need to be innovative and responsive and not hide our heads in the sand and also not be scared,” says Nelson. “We’re brave. Journalists are brave people. We’re being brave by stepping out first in the United States. I think [owner] Paul’s being not only generous and with great foresight, but also being pretty brave.”

There are now two charitable organisations in its place: The Salt Lake Tribune and The Utah Journalism Foundation. The latter will hold the endowment which will in turn be supporting the SLT - and other local news organisations in the state. 

The endowment is expected to grow to about $60 million, at which point the earnings off that will be sufficient to keep a baseline of operation. An advisory board has been created for both: the foundation board more interested in raising money, whilst the diverse community board will oversee the SLT itself.

##Diversity 

“We need to make sure that all of the perspectives that are important to democracy are in the governing board,” Nelson says. “We want people who are really committed to democracy and diverse perspectives on that, so in our community we need to make sure we have Republicans and Democrats. We also have to make sure we have mormons and non-mormons. We have to have people from various ethnic and racial backgrounds.”

In order to maintain transparency, the SLT will publish the name of every donor from a dollar up. As a nonprofit, the law prohibits them from endorsing political candidates or directly telling people how to vote, which has historically been one of the reasons wealthy publishers own newspapers. But there’s nothing that prohibits them from taking aggressive positions on their editorial board, like they did in December when they were part of a dozen daily newspapers such as the New York Times (NYT) and The Washington Post in declaring that president Donald Trump should be impeached.


Whilst newspaper sales dwindle year on year, online readership is a different, brighter story, pointing to something to build upon. Latest figures from the Pew Research Center show online readership plateauing, following a steady rise over the past few years. And a plateau is almost a good thing in the context of newspaper journalism right now.

##Listening to the readers

And in 2020, the SLT will be going on a ‘listening tour’ to find the pulse of the people, in order to shape the newspaper going forward. They’ll be asking young people what they want to read, where they get their news from, and if they worry about its veracity.

“We’re now in the customer service business,” says Nelson. “As a nonprofit, we need to think about everybody we serve as a customer. And we want to make sure that they’re happy and feel heard and that we love them and want them to stick with us.”

As Nelson concludes: “You want the real news, you go to a legitimate source: the NYT, the SLT, The Guardian. Places with editors, places with the public trust… Anyway, it’ll all work itself out. I’m very optimistic.”
